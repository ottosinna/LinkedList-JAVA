This code provides an implementation for a linked list data structure, and it uses a Book class to demonstrate a possible use case. The Book class implements the Comparable interface, enabling books to be compared by their ISBN numbers. It includes methods for getting the book's name and ISBN and overriding the toString method to format the book's information.

The linked list is managed through the LinkedList class, which implements the LinkedListInterface. This class includes methods for adding and removing nodes (both head and tail), searching for items, and clearing the list. Each node in the list is represented by the Node class, which contains the item (in this case, a Book), a reference to the next node, and methods for setting and getting these values.

DriverScanner is the main Driver for this file.
